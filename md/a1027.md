<h1>1027. Colors in Mars (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people.  That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for Red, the middle 2 digits for Green, and the last 2 digits  for Blue.  The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16.  Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.</p>
> <p><b>Input</b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.  
> </p><p>
> </p><p><b>Output</b></p>
> <p>For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output "#", then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased.  If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a "0" to the left. </p>

> <b>Sample Output</b><pre>
> #123456

<h1>1086. Tree Traversals Again (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>An inorder binary tree traversal can be implemented in a non-recursive way with a stack.  For example, suppose that when a 6-node binary tree (with the keys numbered from 1 to 6) is traversed, the stack operations are: push(1); push(2); push(3); pop(); pop(); push(4); pop(); pop(); push(5); push(6); pop(); pop().  Then a unique binary tree (shown in Figure 1) can be generated from this sequence of operations.  Your task is to give the postorder traversal sequence of this tree.

> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (&lt;=30) which is the total number of nodes in a tree (and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to N).  Then 2N lines follow, each describes a stack operation in the format: "Push X" where X is the index of the node being pushed onto the stack; or "Pop" meaning to pop one node from the stack.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding tree in one line.  A solution is guaranteed to exist.  All the numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

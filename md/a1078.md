<h1>1078. Hashing (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>The task of this problem is simple: insert a sequence of distinct positive integers into a hash table, and output the positions of the input numbers.  The hash function is defined to be "H(key) = key % TSize" where TSize is the maximum size of the hash table.  Quadratic probing (with positive increments only) is used to solve the collisions.</p>
> <p>Note that the table size is better to be prime.  If the maximum size given by the user is not prime, you must re-define the table size to be the smallest prime number which is larger than the size given by the user.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains two positive numbers: MSize (&lt;=10<sup>4</sup>) and N (&lt;=MSize) which are the user-defined table size and the number of input numbers, respectively.  Then N distinct positive integers are given in the next line.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print the corresponding positions (index starts from 0) of the input numbers in one line.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.  In case it is impossible to insert the number, print "-" instead.

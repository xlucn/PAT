<!-- Title
Spiral Matrix (25)
-->
This time your job is to fill a sequence of $N$ positive integers into a
**spiral matrix** in non-increasing order. A spiral matrix is filled in from
the first element at the upper-left corner, then move in a clockwise spiral.
The matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, where $m$ and $n$ satisfy the
following: $m\times n$ must be equal to $N$ ; $m\ge n$ ; and $m-n$ is the
minimum of all the possible values.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ . Then the next line contains $N$ positive integers to be
filled into the spiral matrix. All the numbers are no more than $10^4$ . The
numbers in a line are separated by spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output the resulting matrix in $m$ lines, each contains
$n$ numbers. There must be exactly 1 space between two adjacent numbers, and
no extra space at the end of each line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    12
    37 76 20 98 76 42 53 95 60 81 58 93

### Sample Output:

    
    
    98 95 93
    42 37 81
    53 20 76
    58 60 76

<!-- Title
Consecutive Factors (20)
-->
Among all the factors of a positive integer N, there may exist several
consecutive numbers. For example, 630 can be factored as 3 $\times$ 5 $\times$
6 $\times$ 7, where 5, 6, and 7 are the three consecutive numbers. Now given
any positive N, you are supposed to find the maximum number of consecutive
factors, and list the smallest sequence of the consecutive factors.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which gives the integer N (1 $<$ N
$<2^{31}$ ).

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in the first line the maximum number of consecutive
factors. Then in the second line, print the smallest sequence of the
consecutive factors in the format `factor[1]*factor[2]*...*factor[k]`, where
the factors are listed in increasing order, and 1 is NOT included.

### Sample Input:

```
630
```

### Sample Output:

```
3
5*6*7
```

<!-- Title
Social Clusters (30)
-->
When register on a social network, you are always asked to specify your
hobbies in order to find some potential friends with the same hobbies. A
**social cluster** is a set of people who have some of their hobbies in
common. You are supposed to find all the clusters.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line
contains a positive integer $N$ ( $\le 1000$ ), the total number of people in
a social network. Hence the people are numbered from 1 to $N$ . Then $N$ lines
follow, each gives the hobby list of a person in the format:

$K_i$ : $h_i$ [1] $h_i$ [2] ... $h_i$ [ $K_i$ ]

where $K_i$ ( $>0$ ) is the number of hobbies, and $h_i[j]$ is the index of
the $j$ -th hobby, which is an integer in [1, 1000].

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line the total number of clusters in the network.
Then in the second line, print the numbers of people in the clusters in non-
increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and
there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

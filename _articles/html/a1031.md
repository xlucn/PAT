<!-- Title
Hello World for U (20)
-->
Given any string of $N$ ( $\ge 5$ ) characters, you are asked to form the
characters into the shape of `U`. For example, `helloworld` can be printed as:

    
    
    h  d
    e  l
    l  r
    lowo

That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-
down from the left vertical line with $n_1$ characters, then left to right
along the bottom line with $n_2$ characters, and finally bottom-up along the
vertical line with $n_3$ characters. And more, we would like `U` to be as
squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that $n_1 = n_3 = max$ {
$k$ | $k \le n_2$ for all $3 \le n_2 \le N$ } with $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 - 2 = N$ .

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no
less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no
white space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in
the description.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    helloworld!

### Sample Output:

    
    
    h   !
    e   d
    l   l
    lowor

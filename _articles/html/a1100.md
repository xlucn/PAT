<!-- Title
Mars Numbers (20)
-->
People on Mars count their numbers with base 13:

  * Zero on Earth is called "tret" on Mars.
  * The numbers 1 to 12 on Earth is called "jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jly, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec" on Mars, respectively.
  * For the next higher digit, Mars people name the 12 numbers as "tam, hel, maa, huh, tou, kes, hei, elo, syy, lok, mer, jou", respectively.

For examples, the number 29 on Earth is called "hel mar" on Mars; and "elo
nov" on Mars corresponds to 115 on Earth. In order to help communication
between people from these two planets, you are supposed to write a program for
mutual translation between Earth and Mars number systems.

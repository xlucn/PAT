<!-- Title
Dating (20)
-->
Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: `Let's date!
3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a
minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the
coded time `Thursday 14:04` \-- since the first common capital English letter
(case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter
`D`, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the
5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to
23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters
from `A` to `N`, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two
strings is `s` at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two
pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of
no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY
HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week --
that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for
Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is
guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.

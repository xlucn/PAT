<!-- Title
Counting Leaves (30)
-->
A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to
count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line
containing $0<N<100$ , the number of nodes in a tree, and $M$ ( $<N$ ), the
number of non-leaf nodes. Then $M$ lines follow, each in the format:

    
    
    ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
    

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is
the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its
children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `01`.

The input ends with $N$ being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no
child **for every seniority level** starting from the root. The numbers must
be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space
at the end of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where `01` is the root
and `02` is its only child. Hence on the root `01` level, there is `0` leaf
node; and on the next level, there is `1` leaf node. Then we should output `0
1` in a line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    2 1
    01 1 02
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    0 1

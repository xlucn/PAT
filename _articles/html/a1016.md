<!-- Title
Phone Bills (25)
-->
A long-distance telephone company charges its customers by the following
rules:

Making a long-distance call costs a certain amount per minute, depending on
the time of day when the call is made. When a customer starts connecting a
long-distance call, the time will be recorded, and so will be the time when
the customer hangs up the phone. Every calendar month, a bill is sent to the
customer for each minute called (at a rate determined by the time of day).
Your job is to prepare the bills for each month, given a set of phone call
records.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case has two parts: the rate
structure, and the phone call records.

The rate structure consists of a line with 24 non-negative integers denoting
the toll (cents/minute) from 00:00 - 01:00, the toll from 01:00 - 02:00, and
so on for each hour in the day.

The next line contains a positive number $N$ ( $\le 1000$ ), followed by $N$
lines of records. Each phone call record consists of the name of the customer
(string of up to 20 characters without space), the time and date
(`MM:dd:HH:mm`), and the word `on-line` or `off-line`.

For each test case, all dates will be within a single month. Each `on-line`
record is paired with the chronologically next record for the same customer
provided it is an `off-line` record. Any `on-line` records that are not paired
with an `off-line` record are ignored, as are `off-line` records not paired
with an `on-line` record. It is guaranteed that at least one call is well
paired in the input. You may assume that no two records for the same customer
have the same time. Times are recorded using a 24-hour clock.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you must print a phone bill for each customer.

Bills must be printed in alphabetical order of customers' names. For each
customer, first print in a line the name of the customer and the month of the
bill in the format shown by the sample. Then for each time period of a call,
print in one line the beginning and ending time and date (`dd:HH:mm`), the
lasting time (in minute) and the charge of the call. The calls must be listed
in chronological order. Finally, print the total charge for the month in the
format shown by the sample.

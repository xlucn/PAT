<!-- Title
Separate the Animals (35)
-->
There are some animals in a zoo which can be described as a grid with N rows
and M columns. Your task is to place some obstacles so that no pairs of
animals can reach each other.

Two animals can **reach each other** if and only if their cells are
**4-connected**. For example, in Figure 1, the central blue cell can be
reached by the four red cells, and cannot be reached by the other four white
cells.

What is more, you must put obstacles in exactly K cells, which are 4-connected
and form exactly H holes. Here a **hole** is defined as a 4-connected part
with finitely many open cells while the zoo is placed in an infinite open
grid. For example, there are 2 holes (the green and the yellow areas) in
Figure 2.

If K = 8 and H = 1, one way to separate them is the following:

Figure 4

Figure 5 is illegal because it contains no hole.

Figure 5

Figure 6 is also illegal because the obstacles are not 4-connected.

Given some animals, you are supposed to count the number of different
solutions.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
four integers: N, M, K, H (2 $\le$ N, M $\le$ 6; 1 $\le$ K $\le$ 12; 0 $\le$ H
$\le$ 2). All the numbers are separated by spaces.

Then N lines follow, each contains M characters, which are either `.` or `O`,
representing an open cell or an animal, respectively. There will be at least 2
animals.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print a single line containing a single integer: the number of
solutions.

### Sample Input:

```
3 5 8 1
...O.
.O...
.....
```

### Sample Output:

```
8
```

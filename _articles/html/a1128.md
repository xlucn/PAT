<!-- Title
N Queens Puzzle (20)
-->
The "eight queens puzzle" is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an
$8\times 8$ chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a
solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general $N$ queens problem
of placing $N$ non-attacking queens on an $N\times N$ chessboard. (From
Wikipedia - "Eight queens puzzle".)

Here you are NOT asked to solve the puzzles. Instead, you are supposed to
judge whether or not a given configuration of the chessboard is a solution. To
simplify the representation of a chessboard, let us assume that no two queens
will be placed in the same column. Then a configuration can be represented by
a simple integer sequence $(Q_1, Q_2, \cdots , Q_N)$ , where $Q_i$ is the row
number of the queen in the $i$ -th column. For example, Figure 1 can be
represented by (4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5) and it is indeed a solution to the 8
queens puzzle; while Figure 2 can be represented by (4, 6, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9, 5,
3) and is NOT a 9 queens' solution.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains several test cases. The first line gives an integer
$K$ ( $1<K\le 200$ ). Then $K$ lines follow, each gives a configuration in the
format " $N$ $Q_1$ $Q_2$ ... $Q_N$ ", where $4\le N\le 1000$ and it is
guaranteed that $1\le Q_i\le N$ for all $i=1, \cdots , N$ . The numbers are
separated by spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each configuration, if it is a solution to the $N$ queens problem, print
`YES` in a line; or `NO` if not.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    4
    8 4 6 8 2 7 1 3 5
    9 4 6 7 2 8 1 9 5 3
    6 1 5 2 6 4 3
    5 1 3 5 2 4
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES

<!-- Title
The Dominant Color (20)
-->
Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a
series of 24 bits of information for each pixel. In an image, the color with
the largest proportional area is called the dominant color. A **strictly**
dominant color takes more than half of the total area. Now given an image of
resolution $M$ by $N$ (for example, $800\times 600$ ), you are supposed to
point out the strictly dominant color.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
2 positive numbers: $M$ ( $\le 800$ ) and $N$ ( $\le 600$ ) which are the
resolutions of the image. Then $N$ lines follow, each contains $M$ digital
colors in the range [ $0, 2^{24}$ ). It is guaranteed that the strictly
dominant color exists for each input image. All the numbers in a line are
separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.

### Sample Input:

```

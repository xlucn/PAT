<!-- Title
The World's Richest (25)
-->
Forbes magazine publishes every year its list of billionaires based on the
annual ranking of the world's wealthiest people. Now you are supposed to
simulate this job, but concentrate only on the people in a certain range of
ages. That is, given the net worths of $N$ people, you must find the $M$
richest people in a given range of their ages.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
2 positive integers: $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) - the total number of people, and $K$
( $\le 10^3$ ) - the number of queries. Then $N$ lines follow, each contains
the name (string of no more than 8 characters without space), age (integer in
(0, 200]), and the net worth (integer in [ $-10^6, 10^6$ ]) of a person.
Finally there are $K$ lines of queries, each contains three positive integers:
$M$ ( $\le 100$ ) - the maximum number of outputs, and [`Amin`, `Amax`] which
are the range of ages. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each query, first print in a line `Case #X:` where `X` is the query number
starting from 1. Then output the $M$ richest people with their ages in the
range [`Amin`, `Amax`]. Each person's information occupies a line, in the
format

    
    
    Name Age Net_Worth

The outputs must be in non-increasing order of the net worths. In case there
are equal worths, it must be in non-decreasing order of the ages. If both
worths and ages are the same, then the output must be in non-decreasing
alphabetical order of the names. It is guaranteed that there is no two persons
share all the same of the three pieces of information. In case no one is
found, output `None`.

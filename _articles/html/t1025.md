<!-- Title
Keep at Most 100 Characters (35)
-->
Given a string which contains only lower case letters, how many different non-
empty strings you can get if you can keep **AT MOST** 100 characters in the
original order? (Note: The string obtained is a "sub-sequence" of the original
string.)

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which is only one line containing the
string whose length is no larger than 1000.

### Output Specification:

Output the number of different non-empty strings if you can only keep at most
100 characters. **Since the answer might be super large, you only need to
output the answer modulo 1000000007.**

### Sample Input:

    
    
    aabac
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    19
    

### Hint:

The strings are:

`a`, `b`, `c`, `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bc`, `aab`, `aaa`, `aac`, `aba`,
`abc`, `bac`, `aaba`, `aabc`, `abac`, `aaac`, and `aabac`.

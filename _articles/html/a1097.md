<!-- Title
Deduplication on a Linked List (25)
-->
Given a singly linked list $L$ with integer keys, you are supposed to remove
the nodes with duplicated absolute values of the keys. That is, for each value
$K$ , only the first node of which the value or absolute value of its key
equals $K$ will be kept. At the mean time, all the removed nodes must be kept
in a separate list. For example, given $L$ being 21→-15→-15→-7→15, you must
output 21→-15→-7, and the removed list -15→15.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
the address of the first node, and a positive $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) which is the
total number of nodes. The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative integer,
and NULL is represented by $-1$ .

Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

```
Address Key Next
```

where `Address` is the position of the node, `Key` is an integer of which
absolute value is no more than $10^4$ , and `Next` is the position of the next
node.

### Output Specification:

For each case, output the resulting linked list first, then the removed list.
Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.

### Sample Input:

```
00100 5
99999 -7 87654
23854 -15 00000
87654 15 -1
00000 -15 99999
00100 21 23854
```

### Sample Output:

```
00100 21 23854
23854 -15 99999
99999 -7 -1
00000 -15 87654
87654 15 -1
```

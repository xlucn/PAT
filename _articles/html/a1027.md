<!-- Title
Colors in Mars (20)
-->
People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the
Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the
first 2 digits are for `Red`, the middle 2 digits for `Green`, and the last 2
digits for `Blue`. The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C)
instead of 16. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and
168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the
three decimal color values.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following
format: first output `#`, then followed by a 6-digit number where all the
English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit
long, you must print a `0` to its left.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    15 43 71
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    #123456

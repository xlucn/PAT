<!-- Title
String Subtraction (20)
-->
Given two strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ , $S = S_1 - S_2$ is defined to be the
remaining string after taking all the characters in $S_2$ from $S_1$ . Your
task is simply to calculate $S_1 - S_2$ for any given strings. However, it
might not be that simple to do it **fast**.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which
gives $S_1$ and $S_2$ , respectively. The string lengths of both strings are
no more than $10^4$ . It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible
ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a
string.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print $S_1 - S_2$ in one line.

### Sample Input:

```
They are students.
aeiou
```

### Sample Output:

```
Thy r stdnts.
```

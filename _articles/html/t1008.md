<!-- Title
Airline Routes (35)
-->
Given a map of airline routes, you are supposed to check if a round trip can
be planned between any pair of cities.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers $N$ ( $2\le N \le 10^4$ ) and $M$ ( $\le 6N$ ), which
are the total number of cities (hence the cities are numbered from 1 to $N$ )
and the number of airline routes, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each
gives the information of a route in the format of the source city index first,
and then the destination city index, separated by a space. It is guaranteed
that the source is never the same as the destination.

After the map information, another positive integer $K$ is given, which is the
number of queries. Then $K$ lines of queries follow, each contains a pair of
distinct cities' indices.

### Output Specification:

For each query, output in a line `Yes` if a round trip is possible, or `No` if
not.

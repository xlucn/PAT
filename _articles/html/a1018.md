<!-- Title
Public Bike Management (30)
-->
There is a public bike service in Hangzhou City which provides great
convenience to the tourists from all over the world. One may rent a bike at
any station and return it to any other stations in the city.

The Public Bike Management Center (PBMC) keeps monitoring the real-time
capacity of all the stations. A station is said to be in **perfect** condition
if it is exactly half-full. If a station is full or empty, PBMC will collect
or send bikes to adjust the condition of that station to perfect. And more,
all the stations on the way will be adjusted as well.

When a problem station is reported, PBMC will always choose the shortest path
to reach that station. If there are more than one shortest path, the one that
requires the least number of bikes sent from PBMC will be chosen.

The above figure illustrates an example. The stations are represented by
vertices and the roads correspond to the edges. The number on an edge is the
time taken to reach one end station from another. The number written inside a
vertex $S$ is the current number of bikes stored at $S$ . Given that the
maximum capacity of each station is 10. To solve the problem at $S_3$ , we
have 2 different shortest paths:

  1. PBMC -> $S_1$ -> $S_3$ . In this case, 4 bikes must be sent from PBMC, because we can collect 1 bike from $S_1$ and then take 5 bikes to $S_3$ , so that both stations will be in perfect conditions.

  2. PBMC -> $S_2$ -> $S_3$ . This path requires the same time as path 1, but only 3 bikes sent from PBMC and hence is the one that will be chosen.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
4 numbers: $C_{max}$ ( $\le 100$ ), always an even number, is the maximum
capacity of each station; $N$ ( $\le 500$ ), the total number of stations;
$S_p$ , the index of the problem station (the stations are numbered from 1 to
$N$ , and PBMC is represented by the vertex 0); and $M$ , the number of roads.
The second line contains $N$ non-negative numbers $C_i$ ( $i=1,\cdots ,N$ )
where each $C_i$ is the current number of bikes at $S_i$ respectively. Then
$M$ lines follow, each contains 3 numbers: $S_i$ , $S_j$ , and $T_{ij}$ which
describe the time $T_{ij}$ taken to move betwen stations $S_i$ and $S_j$ . All
the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in one line. First output the number of
bikes that PBMC must send. Then after one space, output the path in the
format: $0->S_1->\cdots ->S_p$ . Finally after another space, output the
number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC after the condition of $S_p$ is
adjusted to perfect.

Note that if such a path is not unique, output the one that requires minimum
number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC. The judge's data guarantee
that such a path is unique.

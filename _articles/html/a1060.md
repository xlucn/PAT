<!-- Title
Are They Equal (25)
-->
If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and
12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as $0.123\times 10^5$
with simple chopping. Now given the number of significant digits on a machine
and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in
that machine.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers $N$ , $A$ and
$B$ , where $N$ ( $<100$ ) is the number of significant digits, and $A$ and
$B$ are the two float numbers to be compared. Each float number is non-
negative, no greater than $10^{100}$ , and that its total digit number is less
than 100.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in a line `YES` if the two numbers are treated
equal, and then the number in the standard form `0.d[1]...d[N]*10^k` (`d[1]`>0
unless the number is 0); or `NO` if they are not treated equal, and then the
two numbers in their standard form. All the terms must be separated by a
space, with no extra space at the end of a line.

Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    3 12300 12358.9

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    YES 0.123*10^5

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    3 120 128

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    NO 0.120*10^3 0.128*10^3

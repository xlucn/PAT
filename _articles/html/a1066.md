<!-- Title
Root of AVL Tree (25)
-->
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the
heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any
time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this
property. Figures 1-4 illustrate the rotation rules.

Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to tell the root of the
resulting AVL tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
a positive integer $N$ ( $\le 20$ ) which is the total number of keys to be
inserted. Then $N$ distinct integer keys are given in the next line. All the
numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the root of the resulting AVL tree in one line.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    5
    88 70 61 96 120
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    70
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    7
    88 70 61 96 120 90 65
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    88

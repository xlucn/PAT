<!-- Title
Online Map (30)
-->
Input our current position and a destination, an online map can recommend
several paths. Now your job is to recommend two paths to your user: one is the
shortest, and the other is the fastest. It is guaranteed that a path exists
for any request.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers $N$ ( $2 \le N \le 500$ ), and $M$ , being the total
number of streets intersections on a map, and the number of streets,
respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each describes a street in the format:

    
    
    V1 V2 one-way length time

where `V1` and `V2` are the indices (from 0 to $N-1$ ) of the two ends of the
street; `one-way` is 1 if the street is one-way from `V1` to `V2`, or 0 if
not; `length` is the length of the street; and `time` is the time taken to
pass the street.

Finally a pair of source and destination is given.

### Output Specification:

For each case, first print the shortest path from the source to the
destination with distance `D` in the format:

    
    
    Distance = D: source -> v1 -> ... -> destination

Then in the next line print the fastest path with total time `T`:

    
    
    Time = T: source -> w1 -> ... -> destination

In case the shortest path is not unique, output the fastest one among the
shortest paths, which is guaranteed to be unique. In case the fastest path is
not unique, output the one that passes through the fewest intersections, which
is guaranteed to be unique.

In case the shortest and the fastest paths are identical, print them in one
line in the format:

    
    
    Distance = D; Time = T: source -> u1 -> ... -> destination

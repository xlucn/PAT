<!-- Title
Vertex Cover (25)
-->
A **vertex cover** of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the
graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. Now given a graph with
several vertex sets, you are supposed to tell if each of them is a vertex
cover or not.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers $N$ and $M$ (both no more than $10^4$ ), being the total
numbers of vertices and the edges, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each
describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to $N-1$ ) of the two ends of
the edge.

After the graph, a positive integer $K$ ( $\le$ 100) is given, which is the
number of queries. Then $K$ lines of queries follow, each in the format:

$N_v$ $v[1]$ $v[2] \cdots v[N_v]$

where $N_v$ is the number of vertices in the set, and $v[i]$ 's are the
indices of the vertices.

### Output Specification:

For each query, print in a line `Yes` if the set is a vertex cover, or `No` if
not.

<!-- Title
Google Recruitment (20)
-->
In July 2004, Google posted on a giant billboard along Highway 101 in Silicon
Valley (shown in the picture below) for recruitment. The content is super-
simple, a URL consisting of the first 10-digit prime found in consecutive
digits of the natural constant $e$ . The person who could find this prime
number could go to the next step in Google's hiring process by visiting this
website.

The natural constant $e$ is a well known transcendental number（超越数）. The first
several digits are: $e$ =
2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995957496696762772407663035354759457138217852516642
**7427466391** 932003059921... where the 10 digits in bold are the answer to
Google's question.

Now you are asked to solve a more general problem: find the first K-digit
prime in consecutive digits of any given L-digit number.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives in a line two
positive integers: L ( $\le$ 1,000) and K ( $<$ 10), which are the numbers of
digits of the given number and the prime to be found, respectively. Then the
L-digit number N is given in the next line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in a line the first K-digit prime in consecutive
digits of N. If such a number does not exist, output `404` instead. Note: the
leading zeroes must also be counted as part of the K digits. For example, to
find the 4-digit prime in 200236, 0023 is a solution. However the first digit
2 must not be treated as a solution 0002 since the leading zeroes are not in
the original number.

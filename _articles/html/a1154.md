<!-- Title
Vertex Coloring (25)
-->
A **proper vertex coloring** is a labeling of the graph's vertices with colors
such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same color. A
coloring using at most $k$ colors is called a (proper) **$k$ -coloring**.

Now you are supposed to tell if a given coloring is a proper $k$ -coloring.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers $N$ and $M$ (both no more than $10^4$ ), being the total
numbers of vertices and edges, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each
describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to $N-1$ ) of the two ends of
the edge.

After the graph, a positive integer $K$ ( $\le$ 100) is given, which is the
number of colorings you are supposed to check. Then $K$ lines follow, each
contains $N$ colors which are represented by non-negative integers in the
range of **int**. The $i$ -th color is the color of the $i$ -th vertex.

### Output Specification:

For each coloring, print in a line `k-coloring` if it is a proper `k`-coloring
for some positive `k`, or `No` if not.

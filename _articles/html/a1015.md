<!-- Title
Reversible Primes (20)
-->
A **reversible prime** in any number system is a prime whose "reverse" in that
number system is also a prime. For example in the decimal system 73 is a
reversible prime because its reverse 37 is also a prime.

Now given any two positive integers $N$ ( $< 10^5$ ) and $D$ ( $1 < D \le 10$
), you are supposed to tell if $N$ is a reversible prime with radix $D$ .

### Input Specification:

The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which
contains two integers $N$ and $D$ . The input is finished by a negative $N$ .

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line `Yes` if $N$ is a reversible prime with
radix $D$ , or `No` if not.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    73 10
    23 2
    23 10
    -2

### Sample Output:

    
    
    Yes
    Yes
    No

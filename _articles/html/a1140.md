<!-- Title
Look-and-say Sequence (20)
-->
Look-and-say sequence is a sequence of integers as the following:

```
D, D1, D111, D113, D11231, D112213111, ...
```

where `D` is in [0, 9] except 1. The (n+1)st number is a kind of description
of the nth number. For example, the 2nd number means that there is one `D` in
the 1st number, and hence it is `D1`; the 2nd number consists of one `D`
(corresponding to `D1`) and one 1 (corresponding to 11), therefore the 3rd
number is `D111`; or since the 4th number is `D113`, it consists of one `D`,
two 1's, and one 3, so the next number must be `D11231`. This definition works
for `D` = 1 as well. Now you are supposed to calculate the Nth number in a
look-and-say sequence of a given digit `D`.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which gives `D` (in [0, 9]) and a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 40), separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

Print in a line the Nth number in a look-and-say sequence of `D`.

### Sample Input:

```
1 8
```

### Sample Output:

```
1123123111
```

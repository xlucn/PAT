<!-- Title
Reversing Linked List (25)
-->
Given a constant $K$ and a singly linked list $L$ , you are supposed to
reverse the links of every $K$ elements on $L$ . For example, given $L$ being
1→2→3→4→5→6, if $K = 3$ , then you must output 3→2→1→6→5→4; if $K = 4$ , you
must output 4→3→2→1→5→6.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
the address of the first node, a positive $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) which is the
total number of nodes, and a positive $K$ ( $\le N$ ) which is the length of
the sublist to be reversed. The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative
integer, and NULL is represented by -1.

Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

    
    
    Address Data Next

where `Address` is the position of the node, `Data` is an integer, and `Next`
is the position of the next node.

### Output Specification:

For each case, output the resulting ordered linked list. Each node occupies a
line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    00100 6 4
    00000 4 99999
    00100 1 12309
    68237 6 -1
    33218 3 00000
    99999 5 68237
    12309 2 33218

### Sample Output:

    
    
    00000 4 33218
    33218 3 12309
    12309 2 00100
    00100 1 99999
    99999 5 68237
    68237 6 -1

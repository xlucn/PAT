<!-- Title
Splitting A Linked List (25)
-->
Given a singly linked list, you are supposed to rearrange its elements so that
all the negative values appear before all of the non-negatives, and all the
values in [0, K] appear before all those greater than K. The order of the
elements inside each class must not be changed. For example, given the list
being 18→7→-4→0→5→-6→10→11→-2 and K being 10, you must output
-4→-6→-2→7→0→5→10→18→11.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
the address of the first node, a positive N ( $\le 10^5$ ) which is the total
number of nodes, and a positive K ( $\le 10^3$ ). The address of a node is a
5-digit nonnegative integer, and NULL is represented by $-1$ .

Then N lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

    
    
    Address Data Next
    

where `Address` is the position of the node, `Data` is an integer in $[-10^5,
10^5]$ , and `Next` is the position of the next node. It is guaranteed that
the list is not empty.

### Output Specification:

For each case, output in order (from beginning to the end of the list) the
resulting linked list. Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same
format as in the input.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    00100 9 10
    23333 10 27777
    00000 0 99999
    00100 18 12309
    68237 -6 23333
    33218 -4 00000
    48652 -2 -1
    99999 5 68237
    27777 11 48652
    12309 7 33218
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    33218 -4 68237
    68237 -6 48652
    48652 -2 12309
    12309 7 00000
    00000 0 99999
    99999 5 23333
    23333 10 00100
    00100 18 27777
    27777 11 -1

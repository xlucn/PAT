<!-- Title
To Buy or Not to Buy (20)
-->
Eva would like to make a string of beads with her favorite colors so she went
to a small shop to buy some beads. There were many colorful strings of beads.
However the owner of the shop would only sell the strings in whole pieces.
Hence Eva must check whether a string in the shop contains all the beads she
needs. She now comes to you for help: if the answer is `Yes`, please tell her
the number of extra beads she has to buy; or if the answer is `No`, please
tell her the number of beads missing from the string.

For the sake of simplicity, let's use the characters in the ranges [0-9],
[a-z], and [A-Z] to represent the colors. For example, the 3rd string in
Figure 1 is the one that Eva would like to make. Then the 1st string is okay
since it contains all the necessary beads with 8 extra ones; yet the 2nd one
is not since there is no black bead and one less red bead.

respectively.

### Output Specification:

be exactly 1 space between the answer and the number.

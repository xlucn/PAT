<!-- Title
Sharing (25)
-->
To store English words, one method is to use linked lists and store a word
letter by letter. To save some space, we may let the words share the same
sublist if they share the same suffix. For example, `loading` and `being` are
stored as showed in Figure 1.

You are supposed to find the starting position of the common suffix (e.g. the
position of `i` in Figure 1).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
two addresses of nodes and a positive $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ), where the two
addresses are the addresses of the first nodes of the two words, and $N$ is
the total number of nodes. The address of a node is a 5-digit positive
integer, and NULL is represented by $-1$ .

Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

    
    
    Address Data Next
    

where`Address` is the position of the node, `Data` is the letter contained by
this node which is an English letter chosen from { a-z, A-Z }, and `Next` is
the position of the next node.

### Output Specification:

For each case, simply output the 5-digit starting position of the common
suffix. If the two words have no common suffix, output `-1` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    11111 22222 9
    67890 i 00002
    00010 a 12345
    00003 g -1
    12345 D 67890
    00002 n 00003
    22222 B 23456
    11111 L 00001
    23456 e 67890
    00001 o 00010
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    67890
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    00001 00002 4
    00001 a 10001
    10001 s -1
    00002 a 10002
    10002 t -1
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    -1

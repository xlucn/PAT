<!-- Title
Speech Patterns (25)
-->
People often have a preference among synonyms of the same word. For example,
some may prefer "the police", while others may prefer "the cops". Analyzing
such patterns can help to narrow down a speaker's identity, which is useful
when validating, for example, whether it's still the same person behind an
online avatar.

Now given a paragraph of text sampled from someone's speech, can you find the
person's most commonly used word?

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line of
text no more than 1048576 characters in length, terminated by a carriage
return `\n`. The input contains at least one alphanumerical character, i.e.,
one character from the set [`0-9 A-Z a-z`].

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the most commonly occurring word in the
input text, followed by a space and the number of times it has occurred in the
input. If there are more than one such words, print the lexicographically
smallest one. The word should be printed in all lower case. Here a "word" is
defined as a continuous sequence of alphanumerical characters separated by
non-alphanumerical characters or the line beginning/end.

Note that words are case **insensitive**.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    Can1: "Can a can can a can?  It can!"
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    can 5

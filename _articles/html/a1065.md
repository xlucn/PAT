<!-- Title
A+B and C (64bit) (20)
-->
Given three integers $A$ , $B$ and $C$ in ( $-2^{63}, 2^{63}$ ), you are
supposed to tell whether $A+B > C$ .

### Input Specification:

The first line of the input gives the positive number of test cases, $T$ (
$\le 10$ ). Then $T$ test cases follow, each consists of a single line
containing three integers $A$ , $B$ and $C$ , separated by single spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line `Case #X: true` if $A+B>C$ , or `Case
#X: false` otherwise, where $X$ is the case number (starting from 1).

### Sample Input:

```
3
1 2 3
2 3 4
9223372036854775807 -9223372036854775808 0
```

### Sample Output:

```
Case #1: false
Case #2: true
Case #3: false
```

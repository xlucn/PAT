<!-- Title
Damn Single (25)
-->
"Damn Single (单身狗)" is the Chinese nickname for someone who is being single.
You are supposed to find those who are alone in a big party, so they can be
taken care of.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 50,000), the total number of couples. Then N lines
of the couples follow, each gives a couple of ID's which are 5-digit numbers
(i.e. from 00000 to 99999). After the list of couples, there is a positive
integer M ( $\le$ 10,000) followed by M ID's of the party guests. The numbers
are separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that nobody is having bigamous
marriage (重婚) or dangling with more than one companion.

### Output Specification:

First print in a line the total number of lonely guests. Then in the next
line, print their ID's in increasing order. The numbers must be separated by
exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

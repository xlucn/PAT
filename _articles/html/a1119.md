<!-- Title
Pre- and Post-order Traversals (30)
-->
Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers. A
unique binary tree can be determined by a given pair of postorder and inorder
traversal sequences, or preorder and inorder traversal sequences. However, if
only the postorder and preorder traversal sequences are given, the
corresponding tree may no longer be unique.

Now given a pair of postorder and preorder traversal sequences, you are
supposed to output the corresponding inorder traversal sequence of the tree.
If the tree is not unique, simply output any one of them.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.
The second line gives the preorder sequence and the third line gives the
postorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first printf in a line `Yes` if the tree is unique, or
`No` if not. Then print in the next line the inorder traversal sequence of the
corresponding binary tree. If the solution is not unique, any answer would do.
It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. All the numbers in a line
must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at
the end of the line.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    7
    1 2 3 4 6 7 5
    2 6 7 4 5 3 1

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    Yes
    2 1 6 4 7 3 5

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    4
    1 2 3 4
    2 4 3 1

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    No
    2 1 3 4

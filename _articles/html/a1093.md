<!-- Title
Count PAT's (25)
-->
The string `APPAPT` contains two `PAT`'s as substrings. The first one is
formed by the 2nd, the 4th, and the 6th characters, and the second one is
formed by the 3rd, the 4th, and the 6th characters.

Now given any string, you are supposed to tell the number of `PAT`'s contained
in the string.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is only one line
giving a string of no more than $10^5$ characters containing only `P`, `A`, or
`T`.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the number of `PAT`'s contained in the
string. Since the result may be a huge number, you only have to output the
result moded by 1000000007.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    APPAPT

### Sample Output:

    
    
    2

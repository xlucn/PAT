<!-- Title
Have Fun with Numbers (20)
-->
Notice that the number 123456789 is a 9-digit number consisting exactly the
numbers from 1 to 9, with no duplication. Double it we will obtain 246913578,
which happens to be another 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from
1 to 9, only in a different permutation. Check to see the result if we double
it again!

Now you are suppose to check if there are more numbers with this property.
That is, double a given number with $k$ digits, you are to tell if the
resulting number consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original
number.

### Input Specification:

Each input contains one test case. Each case contains one positive integer
with no more than 20 digits.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line "Yes" if doubling the input number
gives a number that consists of only a permutation of the digits in the
original number, or "No" if not. Then in the next line, print the doubled
number.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    1234567899

### Sample Output:

    
    
    Yes
    2469135798

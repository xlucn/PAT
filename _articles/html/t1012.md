<!-- Title
Greedy Snake (35)
-->
Have you ever played the game "Greedy Snake"? In the game, we control the
movements of the snake to eat the fruits scattered in the game field, while
the snake's body gets longer whenever it eats a fruit. The goal of the game is
to make the snake eat as many fruits as possible, before its head has no where
to go. It would be a real challenge to let you program this game, right now.

But hey! Relax! This time you are only asked to program a simplified version
of the game. In this simple version, the fruits are all over the place except
at some extra obstacle cells. The snake's body will extend all the way along
the path while it eats the fruits. You may take any fruit cell as the starting
position of the snake. Then you have four directions to choose from: UP, DOWN,
LEFT or RIGHT. Once you pick up a direction for the snake, it must keep going
until it hits an obstacle or its own body. This procedure repeats until the
head of the snake has no where to go -- that is, every adjacent cell of its
head is either an obstacle or its own body. Your task is to minimize the
number of fruits left.

For example, let's define the game field to be a 6 by 6 maze, surrounded by
obstacle cells `#`, with one extra obstacle `@`. `S` is the starting position
of the snake. All the fruits are represented by dots.

```
######
#..S@#
#....#
#....#
#....#
######
```

Then if you decide to move DOWN, RIGHT, and UP, the results are shown below.

```
######
#..*@#
#..*.#
#..*.#
#..S.#
######
```

```
######
#..*@#
#..*.#
#..*.#
#..*S#
######
```

```
######
#..*@#
#..*S#
#..**#
#..**#
######
```

Now the snake is stucked, the game is over, and there are 8 fruits left.
However, by carefully changing your moves or choosing another starting
position, you can actually control the snake to eat up all the fruits. Try it
out!

Task 1: minimize the number of fruits left, and count the number of starting
positions that can lead to the optimal solution.

Task 2: To make things more interesting, you may replace one fruit cell by an
obstacle, to obtain a better result, and count the number of ways to add an
obstacle that leads to the better result. In case there is no way to improve
the result by adding one obstacle, you should point out this situation.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
two integers $N$ ( $4 \le N \le 15$ ), the size of the game field, and $K$ (
$0 \le K \le 2$ ), the number of extra obstacles. Then $K$ lines follow, each
gives the coordinates of an obstacle in the format " $x_i$ $y_i$ " where $2
\le x_i, y_i \le N-1$ .

### Output Specification:

For each case, print the results in two lines. In the first line print the
minimal number of fruits left, and the number of different optimal starting
positions. Then in the second line, either print $-1$ if there is no way to
improve the result, or two integers: the better result and the number of
optimal ways to add an obstacle.

### Sample Input 1:

```
6 1
2 5
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
0 4
-1
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
6 2
2 2
3 3
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
2 1
0 2
```

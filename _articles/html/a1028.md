<!-- Title
List Sorting (25)
-->
Excel can sort records according to any column. Now you are supposed to
imitate this function.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
two integers $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) and $C$ , where $N$ is the number of records
and $C$ is the column that you are supposed to sort the records with. Then $N$
lines follow, each contains a record of a student. A student's record consists
of his or her distinct ID (a 6-digit number), name (a string with no more than
8 characters without space), and grade (an integer between 0 and 100,
inclusive).

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output the sorting result in $N$ lines. That is, if $C$ =
1 then the records must be sorted in increasing order according to ID's; if
$C$ = 2 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to
names; and if $C$ = 3 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order
according to grades. If there are several students who have the same name or
grade, they must be sorted according to their ID's in increasing order.

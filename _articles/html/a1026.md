<!-- Title
Table Tennis (30)
-->
A table tennis club has N tables available to the public. The tables are
numbered from 1 to N. For any pair of players, if there are some tables open
when they arrive, they will be assigned to the available table with the
smallest number. If all the tables are occupied, they will have to wait in a
queue. It is assumed that every pair of players can play for at most 2 hours.

Your job is to count for everyone in queue their waiting time, and for each
table the number of players it has served for the day.

One thing that makes this procedure a bit complicated is that the club
reserves some tables for their VIP members. When a VIP table is open, the
first VIP pair in the queue will have the privilege to take it. However, if
there is no VIP in the queue, the next pair of players can take it. On the
other hand, if when it is the turn of a VIP pair, yet no VIP table is
available, they can be assigned as any ordinary players.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
an integer `N` ( $\le$ 10000) - the total number of pairs of players. Then `N`
lines follow, each contains 2 times and a VIP tag: `HH:MM:SS` \- the arriving
time, `P` \- the playing time in minutes of a pair of players, and `tag` \-
which is 1 if they hold a VIP card, or 0 if not. It is guaranteed that the
arriving time is between 08:00:00 and 21:00:00 while the club is open. It is
assumed that no two customers arrives at the same time. Following the players'
info, there are 2 positive integers: `K` ( $\le$ 100) - the number of tables,
and `M` ( $<$ K) - the number of VIP tables. The last line contains `M` table
numbers.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print the arriving time, serving time and the
waiting time for each pair of players in the format shown by the sample. Then
print in a line the number of players served by each table. Notice that the
output must be listed in chronological order of the serving time. The waiting
time must be rounded up to an integer minute(s). If one cannot get a table
before the closing time, their information must NOT be printed.

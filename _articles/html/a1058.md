<!-- Title
A+B in Hogwarts (20)
-->
If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its
own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver
Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough."
Your job is to write a program to compute $A+B$ where $A$ and $B$ are given in
the standard form of `Galleon.Sickle.Knut` (`Galleon` is an integer in [ $0,
10^7$ ], `Sickle` is an integer in [0, 17), and `Knut` is an integer in [0,
29)).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with $A$ and $B$
in the standard form, separated by one space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the sum of $A$ and $B$ in one line, with
the same format as the input.

### Sample Input:

```
3.2.1 10.16.27
```

### Sample Output:

```
14.1.28
```

<!-- Title
Lehmer Code (35)
-->
According to Wikipedia: "In mathematics and in particular in combinatorics,
the **Lehmer code** is a particular way to encode each possible permutation of
a sequence of $n$ numbers." To be more specific, for a given permutation of
items { $A_1$ , $A_2$ , $\cdots$ , $A_n$ }, Lehmer code is a sequence of
numbers { $L_1$ , $L_2$ , $\cdots$ , $L_n$ } such that $L_i$ is the total
number of items from $A_i$ to $A_n$ which are less than $A_i$ . For example,
given { 24, 35, 12, 1, 56, 23 }, the second Lehmer code $L_2$ is 3 since from
35 to 23 there are three items, { 12, 1, 23 }, less than the second item, 35.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ). Then $N$ distinct numbers are given in
the next line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in a line the corresponding Lehmer code. The
numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra
space at the beginning or the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    6
    24 35 12 1 56 23
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3 3 1 0 1 0

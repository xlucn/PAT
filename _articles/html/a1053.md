<!-- Title
Path of Equal Weight (30)
-->
Given a non-empty tree with root $R$ , and with weight $W_i$ assigned to each
tree node $T_i$ . The **weight of a path from $R$ to $L$** is defined to be
the sum of the weights of all the nodes along the path from $R$ to any leaf
node $L$ .

Now given any weighted tree, you are supposed to find all the paths with their
weights equal to a given number. For example, let's consider the tree showed
in the following figure: for each node, the upper number is the node ID which
is a two-digit number, and the lower number is the weight of that node.
Suppose that the given number is 24, then there exists 4 different paths which
have the same given weight: {10 5 2 7}, {10 4 10}, {10 3 3 6 2} and {10 3 3 6
2}, which correspond to the red edges in the figure.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line
containing $0 < N \le 100$ , the number of nodes in a tree, $M$ ( $< N$ ), the
number of non-leaf nodes, and $0 < S < 2^{30}$ , the given weight number. The
next line contains $N$ positive numbers where $W_i$ ( $<1000$ ) corresponds to
the tree node $T_i$ . Then $M$ lines follow, each in the format:

    
    
    ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
    

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is
the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its
children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `00`.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print all the paths with weight S in **non-increasing**
order. Each path occupies a line with printed weights from the root to the
leaf in order. All the numbers must be separated by a space with no extra
space at the end of the line.

Note: sequence $\\{A_1, A_2, \cdots , A_n\\}$ is said to be **greater than**
sequence $\\{B_1, B_2, \cdots , B_m\\}$ if there exists $1 \le k  < min\\{n,
m\\}$ such that $A_i = B_i$ for $i=1, \cdots , k$ , and $A_{k+1} > B_{k+1}$ .

<!-- Title
Read Number in Chinese (25)
-->
Given an integer with no more than 9 digits, you are supposed to read it in
the traditional Chinese way. Output `Fu` first if it is negative. For example,
-123456789 is read as `Fu yi Yi er Qian san Bai si Shi wu Wan liu Qian qi Bai
ba Shi jiu`. Note: zero (`ling`) must be handled correctly according to the
Chinese tradition. For example, 100800 is `yi Shi Wan ling ba Bai`.

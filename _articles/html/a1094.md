<!-- Title
The Largest Generation (25)
-->
A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes
on the same level belong to the same generation. Your task is to find the
generation with the largest population.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with two positive
integers $N$ ( $<100$ ) which is the total number of family members in the
tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to $N$ ), and
$M$ ( $<N$ ) which is the number of family members who have children. Then $M$
lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the
following format:

    
    
    ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a family member, `K` ( $>0$ ) is
the number of his/her children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of
his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root `ID` to be
`01`. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the
level of the corresponding generation. It is assumed that such a generation is
unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    23 13
    21 1 23
    01 4 03 02 04 05
    03 3 06 07 08
    06 2 12 13
    13 1 21
    08 2 15 16
    02 2 09 10
    11 2 19 20
    17 1 22
    05 1 11
    07 1 14
    09 1 17
    10 1 18

### Sample Output:

    
    
    9 4

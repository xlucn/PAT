<!-- Title
Be Unique (20)
-->
Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is
designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number
chosen from [ $1, 10^4$ ]. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For
example, if there are 7 people betting on { 5 31 5 88 67 88 17 }, then the
second one who bets on 31 wins.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins
with a positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) and then followed by $N$ bets. The
numbers are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner,
print `None` instead.

<!-- Title
Integer Factorization (30)
-->
The $K-P$ factorization of a positive integer $N$ is to write $N$ as the sum
of the $P$ -th power of $K$ positive integers. You are supposed to write a
program to find the $K-P$ factorization of $N$ for any positive integers $N$ ,
$K$ and $P$ .

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives in a line the three
positive integers $N$ ( $\le 400$ ), $K$ ( $\le N$ ) and $P$ ( $1 < P\le 7$ ).
The numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each case, if the solution exists, output in the format:

    
    
    N = n[1]^P + ... n[K]^P

where `n[i]` (`i` = 1, ..., `K`) is the `i`-th factor. All the factors must be
printed in non-increasing order.

Note: the solution may not be unique. For example, the 5-2 factorization of
169 has 9 solutions, such as $12^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2$ , or $11^2 + 6^2 +
2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2$ , or more. You must output the one with the maximum sum of
the factors. If there is a tie, the largest factor sequence must be chosen --
sequence { $a_1, a_2, \cdots , a_K$ } is said to be **larger** than { $b_1,
b_2, \cdots , b_K$ } if there exists $1\le L\le K$ such that $a_i=b_i$ for
$i<L$ and $a_L>b_L$ .

If there is no solution, simple output `Impossible`.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    169 5 2

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    169 = 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 5^2

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    169 167 3

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    Impossible

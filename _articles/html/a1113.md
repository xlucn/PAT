<!-- Title
Integer Set Partition (25)
-->
Given a set of $N$ ( $> 1$ ) positive integers, you are supposed to partition
them into two disjoint sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $n_1$ and $n_2$ numbers,
respectively. Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ denote the sums of all the numbers in $A_1$
and $A_2$ , respectively. You are supposed to make the partition so that $|n_1
- n_2|$ is minimized first, and then $|S_1 - S_2|$ is maximized.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an
integer $N$ ( $2 \le N \le 10^5$ ), and then $N$ positive integers follow in
the next line, separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that all the integers and
their sum are less than $2^{31}$ .

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line two numbers: $|n_1 - n_2|$ and $|S_1 - S_2|$ ,
separated by exactly one space.

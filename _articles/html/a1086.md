<!-- Title
Tree Traversals Again (25)
-->
An inorder binary tree traversal can be implemented in a non-recursive way
with a stack. For example, suppose that when a 6-node binary tree (with the
keys numbered from 1 to 6) is traversed, the stack operations are: push(1);
push(2); push(3); pop(); pop(); push(4); pop(); pop(); push(5); push(6);
pop(); pop(). Then a unique binary tree (shown in Figure 1) can be generated
from this sequence of operations. Your task is to give the postorder traversal
sequence of this tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
a positive integer $N$ ( $\le 30$ ) which is the total number of nodes in a
tree (and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to $N$ ). Then $2N$ lines
follow, each describes a stack operation in the format: "Push X" where X is
the index of the node being pushed onto the stack; or "Pop" meaning to pop one
node from the stack.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the postorder traversal sequence of the
corresponding tree in one line. A solution is guaranteed to exist. All the
numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra
space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    6
    Push 1
    Push 2
    Push 3
    Pop
    Pop
    Push 4
    Pop
    Pop
    Push 5
    Push 6
    Pop
    Pop
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3 4 2 6 5 1

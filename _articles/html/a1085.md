<!-- Title
Perfect Sequence (25)
-->
Given a sequence of positive integers and another positive integer $p$ . The
sequence is said to be a **perfect sequence** if $M \le m \times p$ where $M$
and $m$ are the maximum and minimum numbers in the sequence, respectively.

Now given a sequence and a parameter $p$ , you are supposed to find from the
sequence as many numbers as possible to form a perfect subsequence.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
two positive integers $N$ and $p$ , where $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ) is the number of
integers in the sequence, and $p$ ( $\le 10^9$ ) is the parameter. In the
second line there are $N$ positive integers, each is no greater than $10^9$ .

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the maximum number of integers that can
be chosen to form a perfect subsequence.

### Sample Input:

```
10 8
2 3 20 4 5 1 6 7 8 9
```

### Sample Output:

```
8
```

<!-- Title
Kuchiguse (20)
-->
The Japanese language is notorious for its sentence ending particles. Personal
preference of such particles can be considered as a reflection of the
speaker's personality. Such a preference is called "Kuchiguse" and is often
exaggerated artistically in Anime and Manga. For example, the artificial
sentence ending particle "nyan~" is often used as a stereotype for characters
with a cat-like personality:

  * Itai nyan~ (It hurts, nyan~)

  * Ninjin wa iyada nyan~ (I hate carrots, nyan~)

Now given a few lines spoken by the same character, can you find her
Kuchiguse?

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line is an
integer $N$ ( $2\le N\le 100$ ). Following are $N$ file lines of 0~256
(inclusive) characters in length, each representing a character's spoken line.
The spoken lines are case sensitive.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the kuchiguse of the character, i.e.,
the longest common suffix of all $N$ lines. If there is no such suffix, write
`nai`.

<!-- Title
Prime Factors (25)
-->
Given any positive integer $N$ , you are supposed to find all of its prime
factors, and write them in the format $N$ = ${p_1}^{k_1}\times {p_2}^{k_2}
\times \cdots \times {p_m}^{k_m}$ .

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer $N$ in
the range of **long int**.

### Output Specification:

Factor $N$ in the format $N$ `=` $p_1$ `^` $k_1$ `*` $p_2$ `^` $k_2$ `*`…`*`
$p_m$ `^` $k_m$ , where $p_i$ 's are prime factors of $N$ in increasing order,
and the exponent $k_i$ is the number of $p_i$ -- hence when there is only one
$p_i$ , $k_i$ is 1 and must **NOT** be printed out.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    97532468

### Sample Output:

    
    
    97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291

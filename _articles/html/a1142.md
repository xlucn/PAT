<!-- Title
Maximal Clique (25)
-->
A **clique** is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every
two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. A **maximal clique** is a
clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex. (Quoted
from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory>))

Now it is your job to judge if a given subset of vertices can form a maximal
clique.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers Nv ( $\le$ 200), the number of vertices in the graph,
and Ne, the number of undirected edges. Then Ne lines follow, each gives a
pair of vertices of an edge. The vertices are numbered from 1 to Nv.

After the graph, there is another positive integer M ( $\le$ 100). Then M
lines of query follow, each first gives a positive number K ( $\le$ Nv), then
followed by a sequence of K distinct vertices. All the numbers in a line are
separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each of the M queries, print in a line `Yes` if the given subset of
vertices can form a maximal clique; or if it is a clique but not a **maximal
clique** , print `Not Maximal`; or if it is not a clique at all, print `Not a
Clique`.

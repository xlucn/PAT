<!-- Title
Set Similarity (25)
-->
Given two sets of integers, the similarity of the sets is defined to be
$N_c/N_t\times 100\%$ , where $N_c$ is the number of distinct common numbers
shared by the two sets, and $N_t$ is the total number of distinct numbers in
the two sets. Your job is to calculate the similarity of any given pair of
sets.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives a positive
integer $N$ ( $\le 50$ ) which is the total number of sets. Then $N$ lines
follow, each gives a set with a positive $M$ ( $\le 10^4$ ) and followed by
$M$ integers in the range [ $0, 10^9$ ]. After the input of sets, a positive
integer $K$ ( $\le 2000$ ) is given, followed by $K$ lines of queries. Each
query gives a pair of set numbers (the sets are numbered from 1 to $N$ ). All
the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each query, print in one line the similarity of the sets, in the
percentage form accurate up to 1 decimal place.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    3
    3 99 87 101
    4 87 101 5 87
    7 99 101 18 5 135 18 99
    2
    1 2
    1 3

### Sample Output:

    
    
    50.0%
    33.3%

<!-- Title
Cut Rectangles (35)
-->
When a rectangle is cut by a straight line, we can easily obtain two polygons
as the result. But the reversed problem is harder: given two polygons, your
task is to check whether or not they could be obtained by cutting a rectangle.

To give you more trouble, the input polygons are possibly moved, rotated (90
degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees counter-clockwise), or even flipped
(mirrored).

It is assumed that the original rectangle's edges are parallel to the axis.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 20$ ), and then $N$ pairs of polygons are given.
Each polygon is described in the format:

$k$ $x_1$ $y_1$ $\cdots$ $x_k$ $y_k$

where $k$ ( $2 < k \le 10$ ) is the number of vertices on the polygon, and (
$x_i$ , $y_i$ ) ( $0 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^8$ ) are the coordinates of the
vertices, given in either clockwise or counter-clockwise order.

Note: there is no redundant vertex. That is, it is guaranteed that all the
vertices are distinct for each polygon, and that no three consecutive vertices
are on the same line.

### Output Specification:

For each pair of polygons, print in a line either `YES` or `NO` as the answer.

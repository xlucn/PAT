<!-- Title
Is It a Complete AVL Tree (30)
-->
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the
heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any
time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this
property. Figures 1-4 illustrate the rotation rules.

Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to output the level-order
traversal sequence of the resulting AVL tree, and to tell if it is a complete
binary tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
a positive integer N ( $\le$ 20). Then N distinct integer keys are given in
the next line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, insert the keys one by one into an initially empty AVL
tree. Then first print in a line the level-order traversal sequence of the
resulting AVL tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by a space,
and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. Then in the next
line, print `YES` if the tree is complete, or `NO` if not.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    5
    88 70 61 63 65
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    70 63 88 61 65
    YES
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    8
    88 70 61 96 120 90 65 68
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    88 65 96 61 70 90 120 68
    NO

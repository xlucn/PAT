<!-- Title
Rational Sum (20)
-->
Given $N$ rational numbers in the form `numerator/denominator`, you are
supposed to calculate their sum.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a positive
integer $N$ ( $\le 100$ ), followed in the next line $N$ rational numbers
`a1/b1 a2/b2 ...` where all the numerators and denominators are in the range
of **long int**. If there is a negative number, then the sign must appear in
front of the numerator.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output the sum in the simplest form `integer
numerator/denominator` where `integer` is the integer part of the sum,
`numerator` $<$ `denominator`, and the numerator and the denominator have no
common factor. You must output only the fractional part if the integer part is
0.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    5
    2/5 4/15 1/30 -2/60 8/3
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    3 1/3
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    2
    4/3 2/3
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    2
    

### Sample Input 3:

    
    
    3
    1/3 -1/6 1/8
    

### Sample Output 3:

    
    
    7/24

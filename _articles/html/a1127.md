<!-- Title
ZigZagging on a Tree (30)
-->
Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers. A
unique binary tree can be determined by a given pair of postorder and inorder
traversal sequences. And it is a simple standard routine to print the numbers
in level-order. However, if you think the problem is too simple, then you are
too naive. This time you are supposed to print the numbers in "zigzagging
order" -- that is, starting from the root, print the numbers level-by-level,
alternating between left to right and right to left. For example, for the
following tree you must output: 1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.
The second line gives the inorder sequence and the third line gives the
postorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the zigzagging sequence of the tree in a line. All
the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must
be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    8
    12 11 20 17 1 15 8 5
    12 20 17 11 15 8 5 1

### Sample Output:

    
    
    1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15

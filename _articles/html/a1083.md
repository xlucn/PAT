<!-- Title
List Grades (25)
-->
Given a list of $N$ student records with name, ID and grade. You are supposed
to sort the records with respect to the grade in non-increasing order, and
output those student records of which the grades are in a given interval.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case is given in the following
format:

    
    
    N
    name[1] ID[1] grade[1]
    name[2] ID[2] grade[2]
    ... ...
    name[N] ID[N] grade[N]
    grade1 grade2

where `name[i]` and `ID[i]` are strings of no more than 10 characters with no
space, `grade[i]` is an integer in [0, 100], `grade1` and `grade2` are the
boundaries of the grade's interval. It is guaranteed that all the grades are
**distinct**.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the student records of which the grades
are in the given interval [`grade1`, `grade2`] and are in non-increasing
order. Each student record occupies a line with the student's name and ID,
separated by one space. If there is no student's grade in that interval,
output `NONE` instead.

<!-- Title
Triple Inversions (35)
-->
Given a list of $N$ integers $A_1$ , $A_2$ , $A_3$ ,... $A_N$ , there's a
famous problem to count the number of inversions in it. An inversion is
defined as a piar of indices $i < j$ such that $A_i > A_j$ .

Now we have a new challenging problem. You are supposed to count the number of
triple inversions in it. As you may guess, a triple inversion is defined as a
triple of indices $i < j < k$ such that $A_i > A_j > A_k$ . For example, in
the list { 5, 1, 4, 3, 2 } there are 4 triple inversions, namely (5,4,3),
(5,4,2), (5,3,2) and (4,3,2). To simplify the problem, the list $A$ is given
as a permutation of integers from 1 to $N$ .

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ in [ $3, 10^5$ ]. The second line contains a permutation
of integers from 1 to $N$ and each of the integer is separated by a single
space.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the number of triple inversions in the list.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    22
    1 2 3 4 5 16 6 7 8 9 10 19 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 20 13

### Sample Output:

    
    
    8

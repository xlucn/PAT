<!-- Title
Raffle for Weibo Followers (20)
-->
John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a
raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from
every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are
supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
three positive integers M ( $\le$ 1000), N and S, being the total number of
forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the
indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a
nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return)
of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can
win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before,
we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input,
each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print `Keep
going...` instead.

<!-- Title
Counting Nodes in a BST (30)
-->
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has
the following properties:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Insert a sequence of numbers into an initially empty binary search tree. Then
you are supposed to count the total number of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of
the resulting tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 1000$ ) which is the size of the input sequence.
Then given in the next line are the $N$ integers in $[-1000, 1000]$ which are
supposed to be inserted into an initially empty binary search tree.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line the numbers of nodes in the lowest 2 levels
of the resulting tree in the format:

```
n1 + n2 = n
```

where `n1` is the number of nodes in the lowest level, `n2` is that of the
level above, and `n` is the sum.

### Sample Input:

```
9
25 30 42 16 20 20 35 -5 28
```

### Sample Output:

```
2 + 4 = 6
```

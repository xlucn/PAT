<!-- Title
Find More Coins (30)
-->
Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other
planets like Mars. One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could
accept all kinds of coins as payments. However, there was a special
requirement of the payment: for each bill, she must pay the exact amount.
Since she has as many as $10^4$ coins with her, she definitely needs your
help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or
not she can find some coins to pay for it.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
2 positive numbers: `N` ( $\le 10^4$ , the total number of coins) and `M` (
$\le 10^2$ , the amount of money Eva has to pay). The second line contains `N`
face values of the coins, which are all positive numbers. All the numbers in a
line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the face values $V_1 \le V_2 \le \cdots
\le V_k$ such that $V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_k =$ `M`. All the numbers must be
separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.
If such a solution is not unique, output the smallest sequence. If there is no
solution, output "No Solution" instead.

Note: sequence {A[1], A[2], ...} is said to be "smaller" than sequence {B[1],
B[2], ...} if there exists $k \ge 1$ such that A[ $i$ ]=B[ $i$ ] for all $i <
k$ , and A[ $k$ ] $<$ B[ $k$ ].

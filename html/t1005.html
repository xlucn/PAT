<h1>1005. Programming Pattern (35)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>
Programmers often have a preference among program constructs. For example, some may prefer "if(0==a)", while others may prefer "if(!a)".  Analyzing such patterns can help to narrow down a programmer's identity, which is useful for detecting plagiarism.
</p>
<p>Now given some text sampled from someone's program, can you find the person's most commonly used pattern of a specific length?
</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line consisting of the pattern length N (1&lt;=N&lt;=1048576), followed by one line no less than N and no more than 1048576 characters in length, terminated by a carriage return '\n'. The entire input is case sensitive.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, print in one line the length-N substring that occurs most frequently in the input, followed by a space and the number of times it has occurred in the input. If there are multiple such substrings, print the lexicographically smallest one.
</p>
<p>
Whitespace characters in the input should be printed as they are. Also note that there may be multiple occurrences of the same substring overlapping each other.
</p>
<b>Sample Input 1:</b><pre>
4
//A can can can a can.
</pre>
<b>Sample Output 1:</b><pre>
 can 4
</pre>
<b>Sample Input 2:</b><pre>
3
int a=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0;
</pre>
<b>Sample Output 2:</b><pre>
~~~ 19
</pre>

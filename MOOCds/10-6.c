/**
 * 10-排序6 Sort with Swap(0, i)   (25分)
Given any permutation of the numbers {0, 1, 2,..., N-1N−1}, it is easy to sort them in increasing order. But what if Swap(0, *) is the ONLY operation that is allowed to use? For example, to sort {4, 0, 2, 1, 3} we may apply the swap operations in the following way:

Swap(0, 1) => {4, 1, 2, 0, 3}
Swap(0, 3) => {4, 1, 2, 3, 0}
Swap(0, 4) => {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Now you are asked to find the minimum number of swaps need to sort the given permutation of the first NN nonnegative integers.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which gives a positive NN (\le 10^5≤10
​5
​​ ) followed by a permutation sequence of {0, 1, ..., N-1N−1}. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each case, simply print in a line the minimum number of swaps need to sort the given permutation.

Sample Input:

10
3 5 7 2 6 4 9 0 8 1
Sample Output:

9

Tree Traversals (25)
Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers.
Given the postorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to
output the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 30$ ), the total number of nodes in the binary
tree. The second line gives the postorder sequence and the third line gives
the inorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of
the corresponding binary tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by
exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    7
    2 3 1 5 7 6 4
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    4 1 6 3 5 7 2

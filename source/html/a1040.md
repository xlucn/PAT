Longest Symmetric String (25)
Given a string, you are supposed to output the length of the longest symmetric
sub-string. For example, given `Is PAT&TAP symmetric?`, the longest symmetric
sub-string is `s PAT&TAP s`, hence you must output `11`.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a non-empty string of
length no more than 1000.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, simply print the maximum length in a line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    Is PAT&TAP symmetric?
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    11

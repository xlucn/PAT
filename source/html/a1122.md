<!-- Title
Hamiltonian Cycle (25)
-->
The "Hamilton cycle problem" is to find a simple cycle that contains every
vertex in a graph. Such a cycle is called a "Hamiltonian cycle".

In this problem, you are supposed to tell if a given cycle is a Hamiltonian
cycle.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
2 positive integers $N$ ( $2< N \le 200$ ), the number of vertices, and $M$ ,
the number of edges in an undirected graph. Then $M$ lines follow, each
describes an edge in the format `Vertex1 Vertex2`, where the vertices are
numbered from 1 to $N$ . The next line gives a positive integer $K$ which is
the number of queries, followed by $K$ lines of queries, each in the format:

$n$ $V_1$ $V_2$ ... $V_n$

where $n$ is the number of vertices in the list, and $V_i$ 's are the vertices
on a path.

### Output Specification:

For each query, print in a line `YES` if the path does form a Hamiltonian
cycle, or `NO` if not.

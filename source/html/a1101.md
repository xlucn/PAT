<!-- Title
Quick Sort (25)
-->
There is a classical process named **partition** in the famous quick sort
algorithm. In this process we typically choose one element as the pivot. Then
the elements less than the pivot are moved to its left and those larger than
the pivot to its right. Given $N$ distinct positive integers after a run of
partition, could you tell how many elements could be the selected pivot for
this partition?

For example, given $N = 5$ and the numbers 1, 3, 2, 4, and 5. We have:

  * 1 could be the pivot since there is no element to its left and all the elements to its right are larger than it;
  * 3 must not be the pivot since although all the elements to its left are smaller, the number 2 to its right is less than it as well;
  * 2 must not be the pivot since although all the elements to its right are larger, the number 3 to its left is larger than it as well;
  * and for the similar reason, 4 and 5 could also be the pivot.

Hence in total there are 3 pivot candidates.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ). Then the next line contains $N$ distinct
positive integers no larger than $10^9$ . The numbers in a line are separated
by spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in the first line the number of pivot candidates.
Then in the next line print these candidates in increasing order. There must
be exactly 1 space between two adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end
of each line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    5
    1 3 2 4 5
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3
    1 4 5

<!-- Title
Programming Pattern (35)
-->
Programmers often have a preference among program constructs. For example,
some may prefer `if(0==a)`, while others may prefer `if(!a)`. Analyzing such
patterns can help to narrow down a programmer's identity, which is useful for
detecting plagiarism.

Now given some text sampled from someone's program, can you find the person's
most commonly used pattern of a specific length?

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line
consisting of the pattern length $N$ ( $1\le N\le 1048576$ ), followed by one
line no less than $N$ and no more than 1048576 characters in length,
terminated by a carriage return `\n`. The entire input is case sensitive.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the length- $N$ substring that occurs
most frequently in the input, followed by a space and the number of times it
has occurred in the input. If there are multiple such substrings, print the
lexicographically smallest one.

Whitespace characters in the input should be printed as they are. Also note
that there may be multiple occurrences of the same substring overlapping each
other.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    4
    //A can can can a can.
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
     can 4
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    3
    int a=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0;
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    ~~~ 19

Rational Arithmetic (20)
For two rational numbers, your task is to implement the basic arithmetics,
that is, to calculate their sum, difference, product and quotient.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which gives in one line the two
rational numbers in the format `a1/b1 a2/b2`. The numerators and the
denominators are all in the range of long int. If there is a negative sign, it
must appear only in front of the numerator. The denominators are guaranteed to
be non-zero numbers.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in 4 lines the sum, difference, product and quotient
of the two rational numbers, respectively. The format of each line is `number1
operator number2 = result`. Notice that all the rational numbers must be in
their simplest form `k a/b`, where `k` is the integer part, and `a/b` is the
simplest fraction part. If the number is negative, it must be included in a
pair of parentheses. If the denominator in the division is zero, output `Inf`
as the result. It is guaranteed that all the output integers are in the range
of **long int**.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    2/3 -4/2
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    2/3 + (-2) = (-1 1/3)
    2/3 - (-2) = 2 2/3
    2/3 * (-2) = (-1 1/3)
    2/3 / (-2) = (-1/3)
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    5/3 0/6
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    1 2/3 + 0 = 1 2/3
    1 2/3 - 0 = 1 2/3
    1 2/3 * 0 = 0
    1 2/3 / 0 = Inf

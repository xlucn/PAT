Hashing (25)
The task of this problem is simple: insert a sequence of distinct positive
integers into a hash table, and output the positions of the input numbers. The
hash function is defined to be $H(key) = key \% TSize$ where $TSize$ is the
maximum size of the hash table. Quadratic probing (with positive increments
only) is used to solve the collisions.

Note that the table size is better to be prime. If the maximum size given by
the user is not prime, you must re-define the table size to be the smallest
prime number which is larger than the size given by the user.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
two positive numbers: $MSize$ ( $\le 10^4$ ) and $N$ ( $\le MSize$ ) which are
the user-defined table size and the number of input numbers, respectively.
Then $N$ distinct positive integers are given in the next line. All the
numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the corresponding positions (index starts from 0) of
the input numbers in one line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a
space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. In case it is
impossible to insert the number, print "-" instead.

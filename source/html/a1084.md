<!-- Title
Broken Keyboard (20)
-->
On a broken keyboard, some of the keys are worn out. So when you type some
sentences, the characters corresponding to those keys will not appear on
screen.

Now given a string that you are supposed to type, and the string that you
actually type out, please list those keys which are for sure worn out.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the 1st line contains
the original string, and the 2nd line contains the typed-out string. Each
string contains no more than 80 characters which are either English letters
[A-Z] (case insensitive), digital numbers [0-9], or `_` (representing the
space). It is guaranteed that both strings are non-empty.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the keys that are worn out, in the order
of being detected. The English letters must be capitalized. Each worn out key
must be printed once only. It is guaranteed that there is at least one worn
out key.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    7_This_is_a_test
    _hs_s_a_es
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    7TI

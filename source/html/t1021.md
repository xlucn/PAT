Safe Fruit (35)
There are a lot of tips telling us that some fruits must not be eaten with
some other fruits, or we might get ourselves in serious trouble. For example,
bananas can not be eaten with cantaloupe (哈密瓜), otherwise it will lead to
kidney deficiency (肾虚).

Now you are given a long list of such tips, and a big basket of fruits. You
are supposed to pick up those fruits so that it is safe to eat any of them.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers: N, the number of tips, and M, the number of fruits in
the basket. both numbers are no more than 100.

Then two blocks follow. The first block contains N pairs of fruits which must
not be eaten together, each pair occupies a line and there is no duplicated
tips; and the second one contains M fruits together with their prices, again
each pair in a line. To make it simple, each fruit is represented by a 3-digit
ID number. A price is a positive integer which is no more than 1000. All the
numbers in a line are separated by spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each case, first print in a line the maximum number of safe fruits. Then
in the next line list all the safe fruits, in increasing order of their ID's.
The ID's must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra
space at the end of the line. Finally in the third line print the total price
of the above fruits. Since there may be many different solutions, you are
supposed to output the one with a maximum number of safe fruits. In case there
is a tie, output the one with the lowest total price. It is guaranteed that
such a solution is unique.

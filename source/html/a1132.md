Cut Integer (20)
Cutting an integer means to cut a K digits lone integer Z into two integers of
(K/2) digits long integers A and B. For example, after cutting Z = 167334, we
have A = 167 and B = 334. It is interesting to see that Z can be devided by
the product of A and B, as 167334 / (167 $\times$ 334) = 3. Given an integer
Z, you are supposed to test if it is such an integer.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 20). Then N lines follow, each gives an integer Z
(10 $\le$ Z $<2^{31}$ ). It is guaranteed that the number of digits of Z is an
even number.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print a single line `Yes` if it is such a number, or `No` if
not.

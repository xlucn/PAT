<!-- Title
Recover the Smallest Number (30)
-->
Given a collection of number segments, you are supposed to recover the
smallest number from them. For example, given { 32, 321, 3214, 0229, 87 }, we
can recover many numbers such like 32-321-3214-0229-87 or 0229-32-87-321-3214
with respect to different orders of combinations of these segments, and the
smallest number is 0229-321-3214-32-87.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives a positive integer $N$
( $\le 10^4$ ) followed by $N$ number segments. Each segment contains a non-
negative integer of no more than 8 digits. All the numbers in a line are
separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the smallest number in one line. Notice that the
first digit must not be zero.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    5 32 321 3214 0229 87
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    22932132143287

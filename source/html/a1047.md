the registered course list of each student, you are supposed to output the
student name lists of all the courses.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
2 numbers: $N$ ( $\le 40,000$ ), the total number of students, and $K$ ( $\le
2,500$ ), the total number of courses. Then $N$ lines follow, each contains a
student's name (3 capital English letters plus a one-digit number), a positive
number $C$ ( $\le 20$ ) which is the number of courses that this student has
registered, and then followed by $C$ course numbers. For the sake of
simplicity, the courses are numbered from 1 to $K$ .

Stack (30)
Stack is one of the most fundamental data structures, which is based on the
principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). The basic operations include Push
(inserting an element onto the top position) and Pop (deleting the top
element). Now you are supposed to implement a stack with an extra operation:
PeekMedian -- return the median value of all the elements in the stack. With
$N$ elements, the median value is defined to be the $(N/2)$ -th smallest
element if $N$ is even, or $((N+1)/2)$ -th if $N$ is odd.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
a positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ). Then $N$ lines follow, each contains a
command in one of the following 3 formats:

    
    
    Push key
    Pop
    PeekMedian
    

where `key` is a positive integer no more than $10^5$ .

### Output Specification:

For each `Push` command, insert `key` into the stack and output nothing. For
each `Pop` or `PeekMedian` command, print in a line the corresponding returned
value. If the command is invalid, print `Invalid` instead.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    17
    Pop
    PeekMedian
    Push 3
    PeekMedian
    Push 2
    PeekMedian
    Push 1
    PeekMedian
    Pop
    Pop
    Push 5
    Push 4
    PeekMedian
    Pop
    Pop
    Pop
    Pop
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    Invalid
    Invalid
    3
    2
    2
    1
    2
    4

<!-- Title
A Delayed Palindrome (20)
-->
Consider a positive integer $N$ written in standard notation with $k+1$ digits
$a_i$ as $a_k \cdots a_1 a_0$ with $0 \le a_i < 10$ for all $i$ and $a_k > 0$
. Then $N$ is **palindromic** if and only if $a_i = a_{k-i}$ for all $i$ .
Zero is written 0 and is also palindromic by definition.

Non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of
operations. First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is
added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this
is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called **a
delayed palindrome**. (Quoted from
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number> )

Given any positive integer, you are supposed to find its paired palindromic
number.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer no more
than 1000 digits.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print line by line the process of finding the palindromic
number. The format of each line is the following:

    
    
    A + B = C
    

where `A` is the original number, `B` is the reversed `A`, and `C` is their
sum. `A` starts being the input number, and this process ends until `C`
becomes a palindromic number -- in this case we print in the last line `C is a
palindromic number.`; or if a palindromic number cannot be found in 10
iterations, print `Not found in 10 iterations.` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    97152
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    97152 + 25179 = 122331
    122331 + 133221 = 255552
    255552 is a palindromic number.
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    196
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    196 + 691 = 887
    887 + 788 = 1675
    1675 + 5761 = 7436
    7436 + 6347 = 13783
    13783 + 38731 = 52514
    52514 + 41525 = 94039
    94039 + 93049 = 187088
    187088 + 880781 = 1067869
    1067869 + 9687601 = 10755470
    10755470 + 07455701 = 18211171
    Not found in 10 iterations.

Build A Binary Search Tree (30)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has
the following properties:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys,
there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting
tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level
order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1
and 2.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 100$ ) which is the total number of nodes in the
tree. The next $N$ lines each contains the left and the right children of a
node in the format `left_index right_index`, provided that the nodes are
numbered from 0 to $N-1$ , and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing,
then $-1$ will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally $N$ distinct integer
keys are given in the last line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of
that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space
at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    -1 -1
    73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
    

### Sample Output:

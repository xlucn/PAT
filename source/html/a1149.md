Dangerous Goods Packaging (25)
When shipping goods with containers, we have to be careful not to pack some
incompatible goods into the same container, or we might get ourselves in
serious trouble. For example, oxidizing agent （氧化剂） must not be packed with
flammable liquid （易燃液体）, or it can cause explosion.

Now you are given a long list of incompatible goods, and several lists of
goods to be shipped. You are supposed to tell if all the goods in a list can
be packed into the same container.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers: $N$ ( $\le 10^4$ ), the number of pairs of incompatible
goods, and $M$ ( $\le 100$ ), the number of lists of goods to be shipped.

Then two blocks follow. The first block contains N pairs of incompatible
goods, each pair occupies a line; and the second one contains M lists of goods
to be shipped, each list occupies a line in the following format:

    
    
    K G[1] G[2] ... G[K]
    

where `K` ( $\le 1,000$ ) is the number of goods and `G[i]`'s are the IDs of
the goods. To make it simple, each good is represented by a 5-digit ID number.
All the numbers in a line are separated by spaces.

### Output Specification:

For each shipping list, print in a line `Yes` if there are no incompatible
goods in the list, or `No` if not.

<!-- Title
Complete Binary Tree (25)
-->
Given a tree, you are supposed to tell if it is a complete binary tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 20$ ) which is the total number of nodes in the
tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to $N-1$ . Then $N$ lines
follow, each corresponds to a node, and gives the indices of the left and
right children of the node. If the child does not exist, a `-` will be put at
the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line `YES` and the index of the last node if the
tree is a complete binary tree, or `NO` and the index of the root if not.
There must be exactly one space separating the word and the number.

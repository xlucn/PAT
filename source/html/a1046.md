Shortest Distance (20)
The task is really simple: given $N$ exits on a highway which forms a simple
cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of
exits.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
an integer $N$ (in [ $3, 10^5$ ]), followed by $N$ integer distances $D_1$
$D_2$ $\cdots$ $D_N$ , where $D_i$ is the distance between the $i$ -th and the
$(i+1)$ -st exits, and $D_N$ is between the $N$ -th and the 1st exits. All the
numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive
integer $M$ ( $\le 10^4$ ), with $M$ lines follow, each contains a pair of
exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to $N$ . It is
guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than $10^7$ .

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in $M$ lines, each contains the
shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

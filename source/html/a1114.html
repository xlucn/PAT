<p>This time, you are supposed to help us collect the data for family-owned property.  Given each person's family members, and the estate（房产）info under his/her own name, we need to know the size of each family, and the average area and number of sets of their real estate.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=1000).  Then N lines follow, each gives the infomation of a person who owns estate in the format:</p>
<p>
<b>ID Father Mother k Child<sub>1</sub> ... Child<sub>k</sub> M_estate Area</b>
</p>
<p>
where <b>ID</b> is a unique 4-digit identification number for each person; <b>Father</b> and <b>Mother</b> are the ID's of this person's parents (if a parent has passed away, <b>-1</b> will be given instead); <b>k</b> (0&lt;=k&lt;=5) is the number of children of this person; <b>Child<sub>i</sub></b>'s are the ID's of his/her children; <b>M_estate</b> is the total number of sets of the real estate under his/her name; and <b>Area</b> is the total area of his/her estate.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, first print in a line the number of families (all the people that are related directly or indirectly are considered in the same family).  Then output the family info in the format:
</p>
<p>
<b>ID M AVG_sets AVG_area</b>
</p>
<p>
where <b>ID</b> is the smallest ID in the family; <b>M</b> is the total number of family members; <b>AVG_sets</b> is the average number of sets of their real estate; and <b>AVG_area</b> is the average area.  The average numbers must be accurate up to 3 decimal places.  The families must be given in descending order of their average areas, and in ascending order of the ID's if there is a tie.

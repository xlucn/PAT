Infix Expression (25)
Given a syntax tree (binary), you are supposed to output the corresponding
infix expression, with parentheses reflecting the precedences of the
operators.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer N ( $\le$ 20) which is the total number of nodes in the
syntax tree. Then N lines follow, each gives the information of a node (the
$i$ -th line corresponds to the $i$ -th node) in the format:

    
    
    data left_child right_child
    

where `data` is a string of no more than 10 characters, `left_child` and
`right_child` are the indices of this node's left and right children,
respectively. The nodes are indexed from 1 to N. The NULL link is represented
by $-1$ . The figures 1 and 2 correspond to the samples 1 and 2, respectively.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the infix expression, with parentheses
reflecting the precedences of the operators. Note that there must be no extra
parentheses for the final expression, as is shown by the samples. There must
be no space between any symbols.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    8
    * 8 7
    a -1 -1
    * 4 1
    + 2 5
    b -1 -1
    d -1 -1
    - -1 6
    c -1 -1
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    (a+b)*(c*(-d))
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    8
    2.35 -1 -1
    * 6 1
    - -1 4
    % 7 8
    + 2 3
    a -1 -1
    str -1 -1
    871 -1 -1
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    (a*2.35)+(-(str%871))

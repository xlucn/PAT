Is It A Red-Black Tree (30)
There is a kind of balanced binary search tree named **red-black tree** in the
data structure. It has the following 5 properties:

  * (1) Every node is either red or black.
  * (2) The root is black.
  * (3) Every leaf (NULL) is black.
  * (4) If a node is red, then both its children are black.
  * (5) For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

For example, the tree in Figure 1 is a red-black tree, while the ones in
Figure 2 and 3 are not.

For each given binary search tree, you are supposed to tell if it is a legal
red-black tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains several test cases. The first line gives a positive
integer K ( $\le$ 30) which is the total number of cases. For each case, the
first line gives a positive integer N ( $\le$ 30), the total number of nodes
in the binary tree. The second line gives the preorder traversal sequence of
the tree. While all the keys in a tree are positive integers, we use negative
signs to represent red nodes. All the numbers in a line are separated by a
space. The sample input cases correspond to the trees shown in Figure 1, 2 and
3.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in a line "Yes" if the given tree is a red-black
tree, or "No" if not.

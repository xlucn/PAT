<!-- Title
Linked List Sorting (25)
-->
A linked list consists of a series of structures, which are not necessarily
adjacent in memory. We assume that each structure contains an integer `key`
and a `Next` pointer to the next structure. Now given a linked list, you are
supposed to sort the structures according to their key values in increasing
order.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
a positive $N$ ( $< 10^5$ ) and an address of the head node, where $N$ is the
total number of nodes in memory and the address of a node is a 5-digit
positive integer. NULL is represented by $-1$ .

Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

    
    
    Address Key Next
    

where `Address` is the address of the node in memory, `Key` is an integer in [
$-10^5, 10^5$ ], and `Next` is the address of the next node. It is guaranteed
that all the keys are distinct and there is no cycle in the linked list
starting from the head node.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, the output format is the same as that of the input, where
$N$ is the total number of nodes in the list and all the nodes must be sorted
order.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    5 00001
    11111 100 -1
    00001 0 22222
    33333 100000 11111
    12345 -1 33333
    22222 1000 12345
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    5 12345
    12345 -1 00001
    00001 0 11111
    11111 100 22222
    22222 1000 33333
    33333 100000 -1

<!-- Title
Subnumbers (35)
-->
Given a positive integer $N$ , let us define a **subnumber** of $N$ as a
consecutive number of digits **NOT starting with 0**. For example if $N =
1021$ , it has 7 subnumbers, namely, 1, 10, 102, 1021, 2, 21 and 1 (again).
Here is your task: please calculate the sum of all the subnumbers of $N$ . For
1021, the sum is 1+10+102+1021+2+21+1 = 1158. Since the result may be very
large, output the answer modulo 1000000007 ( $10^9 + 7$ ) please.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case, which gives the integer $N$ ( $0 < N <
10^{100000}$ ) in a line.

### Output Specification:

Print in a line the sum of all $N$ 's subnumbers (modulo 1000000007).

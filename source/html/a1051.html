<h1>1051. Pop Sequence (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given a stack which can keep M numbers at most.  Push N numbers in the order of 1, 2, 3, ..., N and pop randomly.  You are supposed to tell if a given sequence of numbers is a possible pop sequence of the stack.  For example, if M is 5 and N is 7, we can obtain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 from the stack, but not 3, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 4.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains 3 numbers (all no more than 1000): M (the maximum capacity of the stack), N (the length of push sequence), and K (the number of pop sequences to be checked).  Then K lines follow, each contains a pop sequence of N numbers.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each pop sequence, print in one line "YES" if it is indeed a possible pop sequence of the stack, or "NO" if not.</p>
<b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
5 7 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
3 2 1 7 5 6 4
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
5 6 4 3 7 2 1
1 7 6 5 4 3 2

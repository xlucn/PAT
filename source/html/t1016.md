Uniqueness of MST (35)
Given any weighted undirected graph, there exists at least one minimum
spanning tree (MST) if the graph is connected. Sometimes the MST may not be
unique though. Here you are supposed to calculate the minimum total weight of
the MST, and also tell if it is unique or not.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line
containing 2 numbers N ( $\le$ 500), and M, which are the total number of
vertices, and the number of edges, respectively. Then M lines follow, each
describes an edge by 3 integers:

    
    
    V1 V2 Weight
    

where `V1` and `V2` are the two ends of the edge (the vertices are numbered
from 1 to N), and `Weight` is the positive weight on that edge. It is
guaranteed that the total weight of the graph will not exceed $2^{30}$ .

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line the total weight of the minimum
spanning tree if there exists one, or else print `No MST` instead. Then if the
MST exists, print in the next line `Yes` if the tree is unique, or `No`
otherwise. There there is no MST, print the number of connected components
instead.

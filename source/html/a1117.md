Eddington Number (25)
British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike. It is said that in order to
show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", $E$ -- that is,
the maximum integer $E$ such that it is for $E$ days that one rides more than
$E$ miles. Eddington's own $E$ was 87.

Now given everyday's distances that one rides for $N$ days, you are supposed
to find the corresponding $E$ ( $\le N$ ).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10^5$ ), the days of continuous riding. Then $N$
non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances
of everyday.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these $N$ days.

Invert a Binary Tree (25)
The following is from Max Howell @twitter:

    
    
    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
    

Now it's your turn to prove that YOU CAN invert a binary tree!

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a
positive integer $N$ ( $\le 10$ ) which is the total number of nodes in the
tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to $N-1$ . Then $N$ lines
follow, each corresponds to a node from 0 to $N-1$ , and gives the indices of
the left and right children of the node. If the child does not exist, a `-`
will be put at the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in the first line the level-order, and then in the
second line the in-order traversal sequences of the inverted tree. There must
be exactly one space between any adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the
end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    8
    1 -
    - -
    0 -
    2 7
    - -
    - -
    5 -
    4 6
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3 7 2 6 4 0 5 1
    6 5 7 4 3 2 0 1

Product of Polynomials (25)
This time, you are supposed to find $A\times B$ where $A$ and $B$ are two
polynomials.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each
line contains the information of a polynomial:

$K$ $N_1$ $a_{N_1}$ $N_2$ $a_{N_2}$ ... $N_K$ $a_{N_K}$

where $K$ is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, $N_i$ and
$a_{N_i}$ ( $i=1, 2, \cdots , K$ ) are the exponents and coefficients,
respectively. It is given that $1\le K \le 10$ , $0 \le N_K < \cdots < N_2 <
N_1 \le 1000$ .

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the product of $A$ and $B$ in one line,
with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be **NO** extra
space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    2 1 2.4 0 3.2
    2 2 1.5 1 0.5
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6

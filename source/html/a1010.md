Radix (25)
Given a pair of positive integers, for example, 6 and 110, can this equation 6
= 110 be true? The answer is `yes`, if 6 is a decimal number and 110 is a
binary number.

Now for any pair of positive integers $N_1$ and $N_2$ , your task is to find
the radix of one number while that of the other is given.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies a line which
contains 4 positive integers:

    
    
    N1 N2 tag radix
    
    

Here `N1` and `N2` each has no more than 10 digits. A digit is less than its
radix and is chosen from the set { 0-9, `a`-`z` } where 0-9 represent the
decimal numbers 0-9, and `a`-`z` represent the decimal numbers 10-35. The last
number `radix` is the radix of `N1` if `tag` is 1, or of `N2` if `tag` is 2.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the radix of the other number so that
the equation `N1` = `N2` is true. If the equation is impossible, print
`Impossible`. If the solution is not unique, output the smallest possible
radix.

### Sample Input 1:

    
    
    6 110 1 10
    

### Sample Output 1:

    
    
    2
    

### Sample Input 2:

    
    
    1 ab 1 2
    

### Sample Output 2:

    
    
    Impossible

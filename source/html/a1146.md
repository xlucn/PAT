<!-- Title
Topological Order (25)
-->
This is a problem given in the Graduate Entrance Exam in 2018: Which of the
following is NOT a topological order obtained from the given directed graph?
Now you are supposed to write a program to test each of the options.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers N ( $\le$ 1,000), the number of vertices in the graph,
and M ( $\le$ 10,000), the number of directed edges. Then M lines follow, each
gives the start and the end vertices of an edge. The vertices are numbered
from 1 to N. After the graph, there is another positive integer K ( $\le$
100). Then K lines of query follow, each gives a permutation of all the
vertices. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

Print in a line all the indices of queries which correspond to "NOT a
topological order". The indices start from zero. All the numbers are separated
by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the
line. It is graranteed that there is at least one answer.

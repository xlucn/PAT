<!-- Title
Heaps (30)
-->
In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure
that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key
(the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less
than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a
heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. (Quoted
from Wikipedia at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure>))

Your job is to tell if a given complete binary tree is a heap.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives
two positive integers: M ( $\le$ 100), the number of trees to be tested; and N
(1 $<$ N $\le$ 1,000), the number of keys in each tree, respectively. Then M
lines follow, each contains N distinct integer keys (all in the range of
**int** ), which gives the level order traversal sequence of a complete binary
tree.

### Output Specification:

For each given tree, print in a line `Max Heap` if it is a max heap, or `Min
Heap` for a min heap, or `Not Heap` if it is not a heap at all. Then in the
next line print the tree's postorder traversal sequence. All the numbers are
separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the
end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    3 8
    98 72 86 60 65 12 23 50
    8 38 25 58 52 82 70 60
    10 28 15 12 34 9 8 56
    

### Sample Output:

    
    
    Max Heap
    50 60 65 72 12 23 86 98
    Min Heap
    60 58 52 38 82 70 25 8
    Not Heap
    56 12 34 28 9 8 15 10

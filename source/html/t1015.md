Letter-moving Game (35)
Here is a simple intersting letter-moving game. The game starts with 2 strings
S and T consist of lower case English letters. S and T contain the same
letters but the orders might be different. In other words S can be obtained by
shuffling letters in String T. At each step, you can move one arbitrary letter
in S either to the beginning or to the end of it. How many steps at least to
change S into T?

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains
the string S, and the second line contains the string T. They consist of only
the lower case English letters and S can be obtained by shuffling T's letters.
The length of S is no larger than 1000.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the least number of steps to change S into T in
the game.

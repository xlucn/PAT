/**
 * 03-树2 List Leaves   (25分)
 * Given a tree, you are supposed to list all the leaves in the order of top 
 * down, and left to right.
 * 
 * Input Specification:
 * Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives 
 * a positive integer N (≤10) which is the total number of nodes in the tree -- 
 * and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1. Then N lines follow, each 
 * corresponds to a node, and gives the indices of the left and right children 
 * of the node. If the child does not exist, a "-" will be put at the position. 
 * Any pair of children are separated by a space.
 * 
 * Output Specification:
 * For each test case, print in one line all the leaves' indices in the order 
 * of top down, and left to right. There must be exactly one space between any 
 * adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of the line.
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 *
